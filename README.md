# Verisure technical assesment

**Hey reviewer!**

I focused on using ES6 and ran the tests on the terminal, I am using node 12 so if you run the tests on a version lower than 11, getInterests wont pass because that version of node doesn't support `Array.flat()`.
 
I chose not to use a polyfill nor Babel since this is not for production and I didn't want to force you to run `npm install`.

I look forward to hearing your comments.
